# Support for the Myanmar Economic Monitor

## Assignment

The Myanmar Prosperity team is responsible for undertaking macroeconomic surveillance of Myanmar and conducting analytical studies to guide economic policy and development, including the bi-annual Myanmar Economic Monitor. However, published data can be delayed or unreliable, making traditional macroeconomic monitoring a challenge. The Lab team was asked to investigate different sources of alternative data to help fill data gaps, covering such areas as conflict monitoring, crop production monitoring, analyzing trends in nighttime lights, and understanding changing patterns of population movement.
